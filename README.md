# OpenTiv2d

Tivect is a 2d free exploration game: "singleplayer and multiplayer, PvP, PvE, build". The goal of the OpenTiv2d project is to expand this freedom for players by finishing what [the original Tivect project](https://game.tivect.com) started: taking the base game and opening back up popular discontinued features while improving performance, accessibility, and customizability.

Starting in Summer 2025, this project plans to

## Roadmap
1. Heavily refactor code, improve performance, and fix minor bugs
2. Improve customizability and accessibility (mobile controls, worldgen settings, customizable keyboard layouts, consistent menu UI/UX)
3. Add back popular removed features (NPCs, vehicles, storage boxes, loading saved worlds)
4. Restore multiplayer worlds, if possible?
4. Extend with new features to fulfill the Tivect mission (better worldgen, weapons system, overhaul multiplayer)
