            Tivect is a 2d free exploration game: "singleplayer and multiplayer, PvP, PvE, build". The goal of the OpenTiv2d project is to expand this freedom for players by finishing what <a class="textlink" href="https://game.tivect.com">the original Tivect project</a> started: taking the base game and opening back up popular discontinued features while improving performance, accessibility, and customizability.

            Tivect is a project rich in development history. Its controls take a while to get used to, but they are loved by the community and help differentiate the game from competitors. Feel free to reference this list while playing:
