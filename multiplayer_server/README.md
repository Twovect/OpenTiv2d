# OpenTiv2d Multiplayer Server

This is the server used to run a multiplayer Tivect game. The singleplayer game works perfectly fine statically, without a server.

In terms of development, this is very much a work in progress and remains mostly in the state from when it was taken from the original repository (see top-level readme for credits). Architecture documentation will go here.

## Running the server

Install modules
```sh
npm install
```

Run the server
```sh
npm run start
```
